## OrgUNETR

This repository contains code for OrgUNETR.
OrgUNETR, a segmentation model analyzing 3D CT scans, demonstrates the capacity to **detecting organ and tumor simultaneously**. OrgUNETR has two distinct output channels, one for the organ prediction and the other for the tumor prediction. Training without organ information fails to detect tumors. However, OrgUNETR successfully detects both organ and tumor by training with organ and tumor information.


## Dataset

We trained our model with kidney organ & tumor dataset(KiTS2019) and prostate organ & tumor dataset(Prostate158) that consist of CT scans. In the CT scans, the location of organ and tumor is annotated. The actual dimenison of the dataset is (512, 512, X) and X are arbitrary number between 29 to 1059. We resized our datasset into (128, 128, 128) uniformly.




## Architecture

The architecture of OrgUNETR is shown below. For details about OrgUNETR, please have a look at our python code.

OrgUNETR consists of two components which are patch embedding layer and **Squeeze and Excitation Layer**. The patch embedding layer, which is typically used in vision models, compresses CT scan into certain dimension. To efficiently enhance the UNETR architecture, we replaced transformer layer in UNETR to Squeeze and Excitation layer. Squeeze and Excitation layer contributes to reducing the number of parameters while maintaining accuracy.




## Performance

![Dice Score for Github](https://github.com/ChoiSanghyukRoy/OrgUNETR/assets/148459212/d664a5f3-2208-4b4b-9c70-2a3181af9ded)

The dice score is used for performance comparison. The graph on the right is a performance evaluation of OrgUNETR with KiTS2019. Additionally, a performance evaluation with a Prostate158 dataset is shown on the left side of the figure. Both graph showed that training with organ and tumor information helps OrgUNETR to detect tumors.




## Prediction Examples

We conducted experiments and the results are shown below

Right figure is the prediction against kidney organ and tumor and left figure is the prediction against prostrate organ and tumor.
